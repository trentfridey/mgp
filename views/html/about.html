            <b>Imagine a place</b> where pixels roamed free, unrestrained (except for a few rules), growing and shrinking, living and
            dying... that was accessible to you through your web browser.
          </p>
            <center>
              <b>.:.</b>
            </center>
          <p>
            That place is here. The game of modular growing pixels is the story of the struggle to live in a world where the rules are fixed
            and each generation depends on its neighbors to survive (or not!). It is finding the delicate balance between overpopulation and
            total annihilation--change the rules and either result may become more likely. But nothing can change the pixels' will to survive...
